- 👋 Hi, I’m Norm Smith
- 👀 I’m interested in initially learning how to use git
- 🌱 I’m currently retired from full time development and playing around with Win32 desktop and Arduino devices and the like.
- 💞️ I'm not looking to collaborate but if anyone stumbles across my code and wishes to suggest improvements, I'm all ears.
- 📫 I can be reached via email at Norm.Aus.Smith@gmail.com
